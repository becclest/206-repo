# params: dictionary such that keys are string and values are integers
# returns: tuple containing string representing the 
#          key associated with the highest integer values
def best_two_keys (my_dict):
	pass

# Things to test:
	# Create a dictionary where you know what the two highest integers are.  

# Corner Cases:
	# 0 and negative numbers
	# Empty dictionar (would have to update spec for this case)
	# Dictionary where there's a tie
	# Dict w/ only one value
	# Malformed dict
